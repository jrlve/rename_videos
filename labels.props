# This file should contain the action labels in the order that you want them.
# There should be one action per line, and there should not be any leading or
# trailing whitespace. This property file should not begin or end with a blank line.
# e.g, if you want `ACTION_ONE` assigned to the video with the first timestamp,
# it should appear on the first line of the file.
# Any line that starts with the `#` character will be ignored by the program.
