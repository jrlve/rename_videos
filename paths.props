# This file should contain the fully qualified (absolute) path of the folders/directories that contain
# the video files.
# There should be one folder/directory per line, and there should not be any leading or
# Trailing whitespace. This property file should not begin or end with a blank line
# Files should be separated with forward slashes (C:/path/to/file) as opposed to back slashes (C:\path\to\file)
# e.g. if you have 2 cameras that each save videos to a `videos` folder, this file might look something like this:
#----------------------------------
# C:/User/Documents/CAMERA_1/videos
# C:/User/Documents/CAMERA_2/videos
#----------------------------------
# Any line that starts with the `#` character will be ignored by the program.
