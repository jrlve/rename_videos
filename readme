Program usage:

Included with the program are 3 .props files,

-labels.props

This file should contain the labels, that you would like applied to the videos,
one per line. The labels should be in the order you would like them applied,
e.i. the label on the first line will be applied to the video with the oldest timestamp,
second line to video with the second oldest timestamp, and so on.

-paths.props

This file should contain the fully qualified path of the folder(s) containing the
video files. One per line.

-extensions.props

This file should contain the extension(s) of the videos files (e.g. mp4, avi, etc.).
The period before the extension should not be included (mp4 instead of .mp4). One per line.

I tried to make the program highly portable, but depending on how you compile it you may need
to add dirent.h to a folder where your compiler can find it. I've included this file
in the `include` folder. If you run into this problem and you're unsure where to place the file,
you'll have to search the internet for the answer.
